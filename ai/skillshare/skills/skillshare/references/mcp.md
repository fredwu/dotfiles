# MCP Connections

Skillshare keeps MCP server definitions in one source and writes each Agent's native
config file from it. It writes settings only: it never starts a configured server, checks
connectivity, resolves a secret or copies OAuth credentials. The exceptions are
`mcp check --live`, which starts or calls servers only when asked, and `mcp serve`,
which runs Skillshare's own read-only skills server.

## Commands

```bash
skillshare mcp --no-tui                             # Plain status (bare mcp opens the TUI)
skillshare mcp add docs --url https://example.com/mcp --target claude --sync --no-tui
skillshare mcp add local --target claude --no-tui -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/docs
skillshare mcp edit docs --url https://updated.example/mcp --no-tui
skillshare mcp import --from claude --json           # Inspect candidates without saving
skillshare mcp import docs --from claude --target claude --sync --no-tui
skillshare sync mcp --dry-run --json                 # Preview without executing servers
skillshare sync mcp                                 # Apply native settings
skillshare mcp remove docs --sync --no-tui           # Remove unchanged managed entries
skillshare mcp remove docs --keep-files --no-tui     # Stop managing; Agent entries stay as they are
skillshare mcp restore BACKUP_ID --dry-run --json     # Preview entry-level restoration
skillshare mcp restore BACKUP_ID --no-tui            # Apply restoration; source stays unchanged
skillshare mcp check --json                          # Static check: variables, commands, DNS, sync state
skillshare mcp check --live --timeout 30s --json     # Also start/call each server: serverInfo, protocol, tools
skillshare mcp serve [--target NAME] [--http ADDR [--tls-cert F --tls-key F]]  # Serve skills read-only over MCP (SEP-2640)
skillshare mcp serve --check [--target NAME]         # List skills serve would skip, then exit
```

## Automation rules

- Pass `--no-tui` or `--json` and every required input. `edit`, `remove` and `restore`
  need a name or backup ID when noninteractive.
- Receiving clients use repeated `--target` (singular), not `--targets`. `--force` is
  unsupported and cannot bypass a conflict.
- `--target none` (YAML `targets: []`) keeps a server in Skillshare and writes it to no
  client; the next sync removes entries it had. Omitting `--target` inherits
  `mcp.targets` instead, and fails when that is empty. Not valid with `--disabled`.
- `add`, `edit`, `import` and `remove` save the source only. Add `--sync` to write the
  Agent files too. `sync --all` includes MCP along with skills, agents and extras.
- Scripted `edit` accepts `--url`, repeated `--target`, `--tools-allow`,
  `--tools-deny`, `--pi-options` or `-- command args`. Switching transport clears the
  fields of the other one.
- `--pi-extension`, `--pi-options-prune` and `--direct-tools` were removed in 0.23.0 and
  fail with a message. See [Upgrading Pi from 0.22](#upgrading-pi-from-022).
- Preview with `skillshare sync mcp --dry-run --json`, then apply with
  `skillshare sync mcp --revision <revision>` to reject a stale plan.
- `mcp check [name...] [--json] [--no-dns]` is read-only; without `--live` it starts nothing. It exits 1
  on an error (unset `fromEnv` variable, command not on PATH, client rule, conflict);
  an unresolved host or an unsynced entry is only a warning. In global mode it also checks
  servers under `mcp.projects`; `--json` marks each with its `project` root.
- `mcp check --live [--timeout 10s]` also starts each local server (your environment plus
  its `env`) and POSTs to each remote one, skipping servers with a static error. A 401 is a
  warning with the resource metadata URL; it never signs in. Use it only for trusted
  servers. `--json` adds `live: {protocolVersion, serverInfo, tools, toolNames}`.
- `mcp serve` serves skills to Agents that cannot reach the synced folders (VMs, MCP
  gateways): stdio by default, global unless `-p`. `--target NAME` applies that target's
  filters. Skipped skills (`SKILL.md` a link or not starting with frontmatter, name not matching
  its directory, description missing or over 1,024 characters, compatibility empty or over 500, over 512 files/16 MiB) are
  listed on stderr; `--check` lists them without serving. `--http` on a non-loopback address requires `SKILLSHARE_MCP_TOKEN` and `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` (or bind loopback behind a TLS proxy). Cross-origin browser requests are refused.
  Do not connect local Agents that already sync skills; they would see each skill twice.
  Connect one with `mcp add skillshare --target CLIENT --sync -- skillshare mcp serve`, or a
  remote `url` with `bearerToken: {fromEnv: SKILLSHARE_MCP_TOKEN}`. Agents with the Skills
  extension load skills natively; as of October 2026 Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Goose and Pi
  lack it and Claude Code's is off by default, so the server also offers `list_skills`
  (`query` filters) and `read_skill` tools, hidden from clients that declare the extension. Verify the server with
  `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli skillshare mcp serve --method skills/list --verify`.
- Noninteractive `import` without a name only lists candidates. Use `--replace` only
  when replacing is intended.
- An `update` with the message `same settings, laid out one field per line` is a
  formatting-only rewrite of a managed JSON entry that sat on one line. Values do not
  change, and entries formatted by hand are left alone.

## Source

Definitions live in `mcp.servers` of the Skillshare config, or in the YAML file named by
`sources.mcp` (top-level `servers`, path relative to the config directory). Never define
both. `mcp.targets` is the default client list; a server's own `targets` overrides it.
MCP targets are independent of skill targets.

```yaml
mcp:
  targets: [claude, codex]
  servers:
    docs:
      url: https://example.com/mcp
      headers:
        X-Api-Key: {fromEnv: DOCS_KEY}     # a reference, never the secret itself
    files:
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/docs"]
      targets: [claude, opencode]
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `command`, `args`, `env` | Local stdio server. `env` values are strings or `{fromEnv: VARIABLE}` |
| `url`, `headers`, `bearerToken` | Streamable HTTP server. `bearerToken` is `{fromEnv: VARIABLE}` and cannot coexist with an Authorization header |
| `transport` | Optional `stdio` or `streamable-http`; inferred when omitted. Legacy SSE is not supported |
| `targets` | Receiving clients for this server. `[]` keeps it in Skillshare only |
| `tools` | `{allow, deny}`: which tools reach the model, translated per Agent. See [Tool policy](#tool-policy) |
| `piOptions` | Other Pi built-in per-server fields. See [Pi](#pi) |
| `disabled` | `true` only, no connection fields, and a project must be in scope: project mode, or a root under `mcp.projects`. See [Turn off a global server in one project](#turn-off-a-global-server-in-one-project) |

Client IDs: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `vscode`, `opencode`, `kilocode`, `grok`,
`antigravity`, `amp`, `claude-desktop`, `cline`, `copilot`, `factory`, `gemini`, `goose`,
`junie`, `kiro`, `lmstudio`, `warp`, `windsurf`, `pi`, `omp`. Scope and transport support vary by
client; the website's MCP command reference lists every native destination and limit.
Names such as `company-docs` (letters, digits, hyphens) work across all clients.

## Ownership and conflicts

- Skillshare only changes entries it wrote. A native entry that already matches the
  source but is not managed yet is planned as `adopt`: sync records it without
  writing, and later removal or unticking removes it.
- A differing unmanaged entry is a conflict. Resolve it with `mcp import --replace` or
  an explicit per-entry replacement. Inspect conflicts with `skillshare mcp --json`.
- Only the fields Skillshare writes are compared. Agent-only fields in an entry, such
  as timeouts, are kept across syncs. Tool filters come from `tools`.
- Turning a managed server off by hand in the Agent's file (`enabled: false`,
  `disabled: true`) is reported as a conflict. Pi and OMP connection entries preserve
  `enabled` as an Agent setting; changing it alone is not a conflict.
- Every write is backed up per Agent file. `mcp restore` restores entries, not the
  source.

## Agent notes

Read the matching note before writing for one of these Agents. They are where MCP
setups usually go wrong.

### Oh My Pi (OMP)

- Target `omp`: global `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json`, project `.omp/mcp.json`; independent
  of Pi. Global MCP honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`. Use `agent: omp` and an explicit
  `config_dir` for a named profile; automatic profile/`PI_CONFIG_DIR` routing is not managed.
- Writes `mcpServers` with `type: stdio` or `type: http` and `${VARIABLE}` references.
  Names have a 100-character limit. Portable SSE imports are not supported.
- Sync keeps `$schema`, `disabledServers`, `enabledServers`, unrelated servers and
  native entry settings (`enabled`, `timeout`, `instructions`, `requestIdFormat`,
  `cwd`, `auth`, `oauth`). Import warns about entry fields it cannot represent;
  keep them in OMP, not `piOptions`.
- The user `disabledServers` denylist wins over every enable setting. Import blocks
  denylisted servers; an entry's `enabled: false` is importable only if the same file's
  `enabledServers` force-enables it. Sync never removes these lists to activate a server.
- Env/header literals starting with `!` could execute commands in OMP: exporting
  them or importing those credentials is refused. Same-name bare env references
  import as `fromEnv`; set the variable before connecting (no literal fallback).
- Pi and OMP share `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`; overlapping MCP destinations are refused.
  Use separate account directories. Project `disabled: true` writes a suppressing
  entry; removing that switch lets the user definition load again.
- Run `/mcp reload`, then `/mcp list` in OMP after syncing. Login/approval remains
  the client's responsibility.

### Claude Code

| Scope | File |
|---|---|
| Global | `~/.claude.json` (honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) |
| Project | `.mcp.json` |

- Another account: a target with `agent:` and `config_dir: <dir>` is an MCP target by its own
  name, and `mcp import --from <name>` reads that file. `claude` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) writes
  `<dir>/.claude.json`, `codex` (`CODEX_HOME`) writes `<dir>/config.toml`, `pi` and `omp`
  (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) write `<dir>/mcp.json`. Global scope only; a project
  uses the Agent's own name, and a project's off switch goes to every account that has the
  server.
- Account shell overrides: when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` or
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` matches a declared account's `config_dir`, the plain Agent
  uses its default home and sync warns. Unrelated overrides are still honored.
  Existing directory aliases, including symlinks and filesystem case aliases, match.
  Files outside resolved destinations are parked with ownership intact; sync
  where that home resolves again to resume managing them.
  For an older removed project, re-add it, sync, then remove it and sync again.
- Reserved names: a server called `workspace`, `claude-in-chrome` or `computer-use` is
  skipped by Claude Code. Skillshare refuses them for `claude`.
- Claude Code never sends its own credentials to a remote server.
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, `HTTPS_PROXY`
  and `NPM_TOKEN` read as empty in `url` and `headers`, so Skillshare refuses them there.
  Copy the credential into a variable with another name and reference that.
- Local scope hides entries. A server added with `claude mcp add` and no `--scope` is
  stored per project in `~/.claude.json` and wins, whole, over the same name in
  `.mcp.json` or the user scope. Project mode reports it beside the entry it hides
  without blocking. Remove it with `claude mcp remove NAME -s local` in that folder.
- Claude Code rewrites `~/.claude.json` constantly. A preview stays valid unless the
  file's MCP entries themselves changed.
- In project mode, `claude` and `copilot` cannot be selected together, and an existing
  `.mcp.json` blocks Copilot CLI sync, because Copilot reads `.mcp.json` first. Use
  global mode for one of them.
- Claude Desktop (`claude-desktop`) is a separate client: global only, stdio only.

### Codex

| Scope | File |
|---|---|
| Global | `~/.codex/config.toml` (honors `CODEX_HOME`) |
| Project | `.codex/config.toml` |

- One `config.toml` is shared by the Codex CLI, the Codex IDE extension and the ChatGPT
  desktop app. A server synced to `codex` appears in all three.
- Codex loads `.codex/config.toml` only in a project it trusts. In an untrusted project
  the synced servers do not load, and Codex shows no error. Check trust first when a
  user reports "synced but missing".
- Only `[mcp_servers.NAME]` tables and their subtables can be edited. Inline or dotted
  definitions are rejected without touching the file; convert them to tables first.
- `cwd`, `http_headers_helper`, approval modes, timeouts (`startup_timeout_sec`) and
  the `oauth` table have no portable form. Import leaves them out with a warning, and
  sync keeps them in the existing entry. `enabled_tools`/`disabled_tools` come from
  `tools` (exact names only) and import back into it.
- Servers bundled by a Codex plugin live under `plugins.<plugin>.mcp_servers` and are
  not managed here.
- `--disabled` is not supported: a lone `enabled = false` breaks Codex's whole config
  where the global server is missing.

### OpenCode

| Scope | File |
|---|---|
| Global | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (honors `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) |
| Project | `opencode.json` in the project root |

- Entries are written in OpenCode's own shape: `local` / `remote` types under `mcp`,
  and `{env:VARIABLE}` for `fromEnv`. Write the portable form in the source; Skillshare
  converts it.
- An existing `opencode.jsonc` is used instead of creating `opencode.json`. A project
  file kept in `.opencode/` is reused too; a new one goes in the project root. If more
  than one exists, sync stops; the user consolidates them first. Comments and unrelated
  settings are preserved.
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, inline config and ancestor-directory files
  are not managed and may override what Skillshare wrote.
- `--disabled` writes `{"enabled": false}` for the named server in the project file.
- Kilo Code (`kilocode`) uses the same format in `kilo.jsonc`. It treats project config
  as untrusted and drops the whole file if it contains an `{env:VARIABLE}` reference,
  so a server using `fromEnv` or `bearerToken` is refused for Kilo in project mode.
  Define it in global mode.

### Pi

Pi >= 0.99.0 has built-in MCP, and it is the only Pi format Skillshare writes. The
third-party `pi-mcp-adapter` and `pi-mcp-extension` are not sync destinations.
Upgrading from 0.22 moves their servers to `mcp.json`: older Pi then stops loading them,
and an extension still installed can replace Pi's built-in MCP, so update Pi and remove
the extension from Pi. Sync warns once when it moves them.

| Scope | File |
|---|---|
| Global | `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` (honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) |
| Project | `.pi/mcp.json` |

Personal servers and servers with credentials belong in the global file. Project
files are for project-required servers in trusted projects; a project entry replaces
the whole global entry. Skillshare edits files with preview/backup; it does not grant
trust, launch servers, install extensions, or authorize OAuth.
`oauth.authServerMetadataUrl` (Pi 1.0+) needs https, or http on localhost. Pi 1.0 keeps
OAuth sign-ins per server name and URL, so renaming a server or changing its `url`
needs a new sign-in in Pi.

Use `pi mcp add` for simple Pi-only setup (`-l` for project). After sync use `/reload`
or a new session, and `/mcp` to inspect connections. `pi mcp list` launches every
enabled server to check connections. `pi mcp login NAME` needs user approval.

`piOptions` holds the other per-server fields of Pi's built-in MCP: `exposure`
(`codemode`, `codemode-deferred` as its older name, `deferred`, `direct`, `hidden`), `toolExposure`
(tool names or wildcards; an exact name wins, then the first matching pattern, and
order is preserved), positive seconds `timeout`, `cwd`, `enabled`, `oauth` and `auth` (`{provider: NAME}`,
https or localhost url, global mode only). Known values are checked; unknown fields such
as `description` pass through. Pi reads names that differ only in `-` and `_` as one
server, so sync refuses the second.

```bash
skillshare mcp add docs --url https://example.com/mcp --target pi --pi-options '{"exposure":"deferred","timeout":120}' --no-tui
skillshare mcp edit docs --pi-options '{}' --no-tui
```

- `oauth.clientRegistration` accepts `dcr` (Pi default) or `cimd` (Pi 1.0.1+). With `cimd`, omit `clientId` and `clientName`; a `callbackUrl` must use HTTP on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` with path `/callback`. The authorization server must support CIMD for public clients.
- `exposure` sits next to `tools` and also sets how allowed tools are offered. Prefer
  `tools` over `toolExposure`; a server cannot set both.
- JSON replaces the source options. A cleared field is removed from Pi's file when
  Skillshare wrote it and it is unchanged; a field the user added stays; a written
  field changed in Pi blocks sync until imported.
- Refused in `piOptions`: main connection fields, `type`, top-level `settings`,
  `autoEnableCodemode`, `directTools`, `includeTools`/`excludeTools` (use `tools`), and
  the other `pi-mcp-adapter` fields (`lifecycle`, `idleTimeout`, `toolPrefix`,
  `bearerTokenEnv` and so on), which built-in MCP does not read.
- Keep credentials in environment references. Portable literal `!command` env/header
  values are refused; command values in `piOptions` are rejected even under
  non-secret keys such as `oauth.clientId`.
- Pi server names allow only letters, digits, `_` and `-`.
- A `.pi/mcp.json` entry with only `enabled`/`exposure`/`toolExposure` is Pi's project
  override (Pi 1.0.1+ `/mcp`), not a server: import skips it, and a same-name project
  server conflicts until the entry is replaced or the override is removed in Pi.
- A `disabled` entry turns a global server off for Pi 1.0.1+ too, in project mode or under
  `mcp.projects`: Skillshare writes that override, `"NAME": {"enabled": false}`, to
  `.pi/mcp.json`, and the global server keeps its args, env and credentials. An override
  Pi already wrote as exactly `{"enabled": false}` is no conflict; Pi settings added in Pi
  to a switch sync wrote are kept, and turning it back on in Pi is a conflict.

## Tool policy

`tools` is written once and translated per Agent on sync:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    github:
      command: github-mcp
      targets: [pi, codex, copilot]
      tools:
        allow: [get_*, search_code] # only these stay; * matches any characters
        deny: [get_secret]          # removed even when allowed
```

```bash
skillshare mcp edit github --tools-allow 'get_*,search_code' --tools-deny get_secret --no-tui
skillshare mcp edit github --tools-allow '' --no-tui      # empty value clears that part
```

The flags work on `add`, `edit` and `import`; lists are comma-separated. Only `*` is a
wildcard; `? [ ] { }`, spaces, commas, duplicates, a deny list that removes every
allowed tool, and `tools` on a `disabled` entry are errors.

| Agent | Applies |
|---|---|
| `pi` | Everything: `toolExposure` (denied `hidden`, then allowed at `piOptions.exposure` or `codemode`, then `"*": "hidden"` when allow is set) |
| `codex` | `enabled_tools`/`disabled_tools`, exact names only; not allow patterns |
| `copilot` | `tools`: exact allowed names minus denied, else `["*"]`; no allow patterns, or deny without exact allow names |
| `opencode`, `kilocode`, all others | Nothing; their tool filters live in a top-level permission map |

Unapplied parts are never dropped silently: the plan prints
`tool policy not applied for <target>: <parts> (<servers>)` (JSON `notices`), and
`mcp check` reports a `tools` warning per Agent. Import maps Codex and Copilot tool
lists back to `tools`, and Pi `toolExposure` only when it round-trips exactly
(otherwise it stays in `piOptions` with a warning); `exposure` stays in `piOptions`.

## Upgrading Pi from 0.22

Older configs still load; `sync mcp --dry-run` warns per kind and names the servers.
The first real sync (`sync mcp`, `sync --all`, or the dashboard's sync) converts them,
writes the Agent files, then saves `config.yaml` (or the `sources.mcp` file) without the
retired keys, keeping the old file in `backup files` history with reason `migrate` and
printing `Updated config.yaml for 0.23.0 (backup: <path>)`. `--dry-run` writes nothing.

- `piExtension` is removed. Adapter servers move to `mcp.json`, and the entries
  Skillshare wrote in `mcp-adapter.json` are removed; hand-written ones stay.
  Extension entries are rewritten in place.
- `piOptionsPrune` is removed; pruning unchanged owned fields is always on.
- `directTools`: `true` → `piOptions.exposure: direct`, `"search"` → `deferred`, a list
  → `toolExposure` entries `direct`. `mcp.directTools` and a project's `directTools`
  apply to servers that reach Pi without their own value.
- `piOptions.includeTools`/`excludeTools` → `tools.allow`/`tools.deny` (a
  `directTools` next to them still becomes `piOptions.exposure`).
- Other adapter-only `piOptions` are dropped.
- `--pi-extension` and `--pi-options-prune`: drop them. `--direct-tools`: use
  `--pi-options '{"exposure":"direct"}'`, or `--pi-options '{"toolExposure":{"TOOL":"direct"}}'`.
- `mcp import --from pi` still reads `mcp-adapter.json` (read-only; `mcp.json` wins on
  the same name) and converts its tool settings.

## Turn off a global server in one project

Needs a project in scope: `-p`, a folder with `.skillshare/config.yaml`, or a root under
`mcp.projects` in the global config. It writes just the switch; OpenCode, Kilo Code
and Pi keep the global connection, while OMP suppresses the same-named entry. NAME must be the name in the Agent's own global config;
Skillshare does not check that it exists there.

| Target | Supported | Written |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Yes | name added to this project's `disabledMcpServers` in `~/.claude.json` (per machine) |
| `opencode`, `kilocode` | Yes | `{"enabled": false}` |
| `pi` | Pi 1.0.1+ | `{"enabled": false}`, Pi's project override |
| `omp` | Yes | `{"enabled": false}`, suppresses the same-named user entry |
| `codex` | No | see [Codex](#codex) |
| All other targets | No | Error, nothing written |

```bash
skillshare mcp add NAME --disabled --target opencode -p --no-tui
skillshare sync mcp -p
```

- `--disabled` cannot be combined with `--url` or `-- command`. Without `--target` the
  entry follows the project's targets: each sync sends it to the clients that have a
  switch (under `mcp.projects`, also only those the global server of that name goes to).
  With `--target`, an unsupported client is an error.
- Claude's off list is per machine and keyed by the project's absolute path. Each
  teammate syncs once in their own checkout, and a moved project needs a new sync. A
  name the user turned off in `/mcp` themselves is never claimed or removed.
- To turn the server back on, `skillshare mcp remove NAME -p --sync`.
- For a server Skillshare itself defines, unselect the Agent on that server instead.

## Several projects from the global config

`mcp.projects` in the global config writes project files for many folders in one sync,
without a `.skillshare/config.yaml` in each. Keys are absolute paths or start with `~`.
Each project takes `targets` and `servers`; missing `targets` inherit the global ones.

```yaml
# ~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml
mcp:
  targets: [claude, opencode]
  servers:
    context7:
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
  projects:
    ~/work/project01:
      servers:
        context7:                  # off in this project only
          disabled: true
          targets: [opencode]
    ~/work/project02:
      servers:
        internal-docs:             # exists in this project only
          url: https://example.com/mcp
          targets: [opencode]
```

- A project lists only what differs. Global servers already load in every project,
  because the Agent reads its global and project files together; do not repeat them. A
  `disabled` entry only switches one off in that folder.
- No command edits `mcp.projects`; `mcp add` leaves it as written. Edit `config.yaml`, or
  use the dashboard: the MCP page's **Projects** tab adds and removes projects, turns
  global servers off per project and edits project servers.
- `disabled` under `mcp.projects` cannot target `claude`. Use project mode in that
  folder instead.
- It is refused inside a project config. A folder whose own `.skillshare/config.yaml`
  manages the same entry produces a conflict, not an overwrite.
- Removing a project from the list removes the entries Skillshare wrote there.
- To share one definition between projects, use a YAML anchor kept inside
  `mcp.projects`.
- The preview names the file when one server appears in several places.

## Interactive use

For a person at a terminal: `skillshare mcp` opens the manager (`/` filter,
`n` add, `i` import, `e` edit, `d` remove, `s` sync, `r` restore, `?` all keys). `mcp add`
guides URL or JSON setup, `mcp edit` opens a server picker and editor, `mcp import
--from claude` offers batch selection with one preview, and `mcp restore` browses
backups. Review screens scroll before confirmation, and Esc cancels without saving. The
TUI offers "Save only" or "Save and sync" instead of `--sync`. An agent running
commands for the user should stay on `--no-tui` or `--json`.

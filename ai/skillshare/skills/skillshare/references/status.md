# Status & Inspection Commands

Commands with auto-detection run in project mode when `.skillshare/config.yaml` exists in cwd. Use `-g` to force global.

## status

Overview of source, targets, and sync state.

```bash
skillshare status          # Auto-detects mode
skillshare status -g       # Force global
skillshare status --json   # JSON output (global mode only)
```

Project mode output includes: source path, targets with sync mode, remote skills list.

**Sync drift detection:** Warns when targets have fewer linked skills than source (merge mode). Example: `⚠ claude: 3 skill(s) not synced (12/15 linked)`. Run `skillshare sync` to fix.

## diff

Show differences between source and targets. Interactive TUI on TTY, plain text otherwise.

```bash
skillshare diff                # Interactive TUI (default on TTY)
skillshare diff claude         # Specific target
skillshare diff --stat         # File-level changes (plain text)
skillshare diff --patch        # Full unified diff (plain text)
skillshare diff --no-tui       # Plain text, skip TUI
skillshare diff --json         # JSON output (implies --no-tui)
skillshare diff -p             # Project mode
skillshare diff -g             # Force global
```

TUI features: left panel target list with status icons (`✓`/`!`/`✗`), right panel detail with categorized diffs. Enter expands file-level diff. `--stat` and `--patch` imply `--no-tui`.

## list

List installed skills. Interactive TUI on TTY, plain text otherwise.

```bash
skillshare list                # Interactive TUI (default on TTY)
skillshare list react          # Filter by name/path/source
skillshare list --type local   # Filter by type: tracked, local, github
skillshare list --sort newest  # Sort: name (default), newest, oldest
skillshare list --verbose      # Detailed plain text view
skillshare list --json         # JSON output (recommended for AI usage)
skillshare list --no-tui       # Plain text, skip TUI
skillshare list -g             # Force global
```

TUI features: fuzzy filter (type to search), detail panel (description, path, files, synced targets). Use `--json` for programmatic inspection: `skillshare list --json | jq '.[] | {name, source, type}'`.

## search

Search GitHub for skills (repos containing SKILL.md).

```bash
skillshare search <query>           # Interactive (select to install)
skillshare search <query> --list    # List only
skillshare search <query> --json    # JSON output
skillshare search <query> -n 10     # Limit results (default: 20)
```

**Requires:** GitHub auth (`gh` CLI or `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var).

**Query examples:**
- `react performance` - Performance optimization
- `pr review` - Code review skills
- `commit` - Git commit helpers
- `changelog` - Changelog generation

## doctor

Diagnose configuration and environment issues. Also checks for sync drift.

```bash
skillshare doctor
```

## upgrade

Upgrade CLI binary and/or built-in skillshare skill.

```bash
skillshare upgrade              # Both CLI + skill
skillshare upgrade --cli        # CLI only
skillshare upgrade --skill      # Skill only
skillshare upgrade --force      # Skip confirmation
skillshare upgrade --dry-run    # Preview
```

**Note:** `upgrade --skill` is opt-in — it won't auto-install the built-in skill if it's not already present. Use `init --skill` or `upgrade --skill` to install it explicitly.

**After upgrading skill:** `skillshare sync`

# Status & Inspection Commands

Commands with auto-detection run in project mode when a project config (`.skillshare/config.yaml` or `skillshare/config.yaml`) is found. Use `-g` to force global.

## status

Overview of source, targets, and sync state.

```bash
skillshare status          # Auto-detects mode
skillshare status -g       # Force global
skillshare status --json   # JSON output (global and project)
```

Project mode output includes: source path, targets with sync mode, remote skills list.

**Sync drift detection:** Warns when targets have fewer linked skills than source (merge mode). Example: `⚠ claude: 3 skill(s) not synced (12/15 linked)`. Run `skillshare sync` to fix.

In Windows copy fallback, agent counts in `status` and `doctor` distinguish identical unowned files as `local preserved` (for example, `0/1 linked, 1 local preserved`). Up-to-date managed copies still count as linked.

## diff

Show differences between source and targets. Interactive TUI on TTY, plain text otherwise.

```bash
skillshare diff                # Interactive TUI (default on TTY)
skillshare diff claude         # Specific target
skillshare diff --stat         # File-level changes (plain text)
skillshare diff --patch        # Full unified diff (plain text)
skillshare diff --no-tui       # Plain text, skip TUI
skillshare diff --json         # JSON output (implies --no-tui)
skillshare diff -p             # Project mode
skillshare diff -g             # Force global
```

TUI features: left panel target list with status icons (`✓`/`!`/`✗`), right panel detail with categorized diffs. Enter expands file-level diff. `--stat` and `--patch` imply `--no-tui`.

## list

List installed skills. Interactive TUI on TTY, plain text otherwise.

```bash
skillshare list                # Interactive TUI (default on TTY)
skillshare list react          # Filter by name/path/source
skillshare list --type local   # Filter by type: tracked, local, github
skillshare list --status disabled # Filter by status: all (default), enabled, disabled
skillshare list --sort newest  # Sort: name (default), newest, oldest
skillshare list --verbose      # Detailed plain text view
skillshare list --json         # JSON output (recommended for AI usage)
skillshare list --no-tui       # Plain text, skip TUI
skillshare list -g             # Force global
```

TUI features: fuzzy filter (type to search), detail panel (description, path, files, synced targets). Use `--json` for programmatic inspection: `skillshare list --json | jq '.[] | {name, source, type}'`.

## search

Search GitHub for skills (repos containing SKILL.md).

```bash
skillshare search <query>           # Interactive (select to install)
skillshare search <query> --list    # List only
skillshare search <query> --json    # JSON output
skillshare search <query> -n 10     # Limit results (default: 20)
```

**Requires:** GitHub auth (`gh` CLI or `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var).

**Query examples:**
- `react performance` - Performance optimization
- `pr review` - Code review skills
- `commit` - Git commit helpers
- `changelog` - Changelog generation

## doctor

Diagnose configuration and environment issues. Also checks sync drift for skills, agents and extras, plus MCP servers, hooks and plugins (offline; `mcp check --live` and `plugin check` go further).

In global and project mode, each first-level symlink or Windows junction in the skills source gets a line. With `follow_source_links` off (default) it is info: discovery does not follow it, so its contents are invisible to skillshare; set `follow_source_links: true` in the global or project config to follow such links one level. With it on, the line says `followed as a directory`, or warns `not followed: <reason>` (target missing, source root, or sync target overlap); target links behind an unavailable link are reported as kept, not as broken links to prune. With no such links, it adds no output. In `doctor --json`, each link is an `undeclared_source_links` check with status `info` or `warning`.

```bash
skillshare doctor
```

## analyze

Use `skillshare analyze --json` to inspect description/body size and estimated context
cost per target. Estimates describe loaded skill text, not measured billing or cache savings.
Use `--no-tui` for plain terminal output.

## upgrade

Upgrade CLI binary and/or built-in skillshare skill.

The macOS/Linux install script defaults to `~/.local/bin`, so normal updates do not
need `sudo`. Keep that directory first in PATH; the installer warns if an older
binary takes precedence. Existing installations stay in place, and updates to a
protected custom directory can still require `sudo`.

```bash
skillshare upgrade              # Both CLI + skill
skillshare upgrade --cli        # CLI only
skillshare upgrade --skill      # Skill only
skillshare upgrade --force      # Skip confirmation
skillshare upgrade --dry-run    # Preview
```

**Missing built-in skill:** `upgrade --skill` prompts before installing it;
`upgrade --skill --force` installs without that prompt. Use this only when installation
is requested. `init --skill` also opts in explicitly.

**After upgrading skill:** `skillshare sync`

`list` and `status` warn when an enabled `follow_source_links` policy skips an unavailable first-level source link; healthy skills remain in the inventory. With `--json`, warnings go to stderr so stdout stays valid JSON.

The dashboard Updates tab lists followed Git checkouts as information only, with the link name and target path. It does not check, update, or force-retry them; manage them yourself or use `skillshare update <link>` explicitly.
